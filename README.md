# Bedwars Chat Stats

mod that sends information about your hypixel bedwars enemies to your party chat

WIP

## Roadmap / to-do list
- lags whole game when checking stats
- allow caps in aliases
- when "/bwcs aaaa" is run nothing is shown - it should probably show /bwcs help output
- all commands colors & formatting to look nicer
- click to copy in /bwcs getapikey
- order team messages and say who to target
- brain function to check if theyre nicked (if 0.00 stats then /w name) and warn if they are
- move my toggled and null key check to somewhere else or further out so that it doesnt even have to check all incoming chat msgs if its toggled off
- check if key is invalid so it doesnt give wrong info
- i might want to find a new method for checking when game starts, lowcraw doesnt work bc i cant tell when it starts. i could use scoreboard
- make it so if youre in solos it just shows client side msgs not party chat msgs
